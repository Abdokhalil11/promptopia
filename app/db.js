      "Honey never spoils due to its unique chemical composition. It is highly acidic, with a pH ranging from 3.2 to 4.5, and has a low moisture content, both of which inhibit the growth of bacteria and microorganisms. Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. This long shelf life is one of the reasons honey has been prized throughout history, not just as a food source but also for its medicinal properties.    ",

      "Octopuses are fascinating creatures with several unique features, including having three hearts. Two of these hearts pump blood through the gills, where it is oxygenated, while the third heart pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. Octopus blood is blue rather than red due to the presence of hemocyanin, a copper-based molecule that is more efficient at transporting oxygen in cold and low-oxygen environments. These features allow octopuses to thrive in a variety of marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea.",

      "Oxford University is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world, with origins dating back to the late 11th century. Teaching at Oxford started as early as 1096, making it older than the Aztec civilization, which began around 1325. Over the centuries, Oxford has produced numerous notable alumni, including renowned scientists, writers, and political leaders, contributing significantly to various fields of knowledge and human endeavor.Oxford University is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world, with origins dating back to the late 11th century.

      "Bananas are botanically classified as berries, while strawberries are not. This classification is due to the way these fruits develop. Bananas develop from a single ovary and contain multiple seeds, fitting the botanical criteria for berries. Strawberries, on the other hand, develop from multiple ovaries and have their seeds on the outside, classifying them as aggregate fruits rather than true berries.",

      "The Eiffel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, can grow up to 15 centimeters taller during the summer. This phenomenon is due to thermal expansion, where the iron structure expands as the temperature increases. Conversely, the tower contracts during the winter when temperatures drop. This subtle change in height is a fascinating example of the principles of physics at work in everyday structures.",

      "Venus has an exceptionally slow rotation, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis. Interestingly, it takes only about 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun. As a result, a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus. This slow rotation, combined with the planet's thick atmosphere and extreme surface conditions, makes Venus a subject of great interest and study in the field of planetary science.",

    prompt: "Giraffes are 30 times more likely to get hit by lightning than people. True, there are only five well-documented fatal lightning strikes on giraffes between 1996 and 2010. But due to the population of the species being just 140,000 during this time, it makes for about 0.003 lightning deaths per thousand giraffes each year. This is 30 times the equivalent fatality rate for humans.",
